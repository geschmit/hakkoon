- original prog is a bit bloaty. condense related libs & funcs
- perform an overhaul of how stuff is referred. tickets -> hours in all doc cases
- redesign how sessions could be handled. keep current format but figure out how to document easier
- (IMPORTANT) add intro skip. people sometimes dont wanna see that, they know whats going on
- async vs multithreads: what can we do different?
